**Instagram Clone**

This project was created with React Native, Expo and Supabase!

## How does this work?

![Welcome Instagram Screen](https://i.ibb.co/7YTX7J9/1.jpg)
At first, the user is greeted with Welcome screen which has 'Start your journey button' that take him to another screen.

Now we have auth flow, of course if user is not already logged in.

![Signup Screen](https://i.ibb.co/hWmtX8R/3.jpg)
User can log in or sign up.

My project has professional form validation as well.

After the user registers for the first time, he must enter his name, surname and add a profile picture.
You can add a photo from your device or use your phone's camera to take up a new picture.

Posts from all users are displayed on the homepage. Anyone can like them or add a new comment.

![Post details screen](https://i.ibb.co/FgC2pFM/7.jpg)
After clicking on the post, the user is redirected to the post details screen. Here you can also like a post or add a new comment. If the user is the author of the post, he can delete it.

Of course you can add a new post. Add a description and choose a photo from your phone or take a new photo using your camera.

Posts can be easily found using the search engine. After clicking on the searched post, the user will be redirected to the post details screen.

In this project I also added user screen, where you can find your profile info and your posts.
